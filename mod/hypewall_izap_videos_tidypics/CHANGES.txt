Changelog
=========

2.3.3
-----

- Requires Elgg 2.3.0 at minimum,
- No longer load Elgg's lighbox JS and CSS because they are loaded by core on all pages now anyway,
- Added missing brackets in elgg_get_logged_in_user_guid() function call.

1.9.2
-----

- Verified that it works on Elgg 1.9 - 1.12 and 2.0 (should also work on future Elgg 2.X versions) - tested with hypeWall version 4.3.0,
- composer.json added,
- Added support for Tidypics, i.e. if Tidypics is installed a menu item is added to the hypeWall menu for quick access to image uploading,
- Renaming of plugin folder (and plugin id) from hypeWall_izap_videos to hypewall_izap_videos_tidypics because Packagist doesn't allow upper case letter in repo names (without renaming a composer based install wouldn't have been possible to offer) and to indicate the support of Tidypics.
