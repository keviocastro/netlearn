Description
-----------

This plugin adds menu items to the hypeWall menu that directs a user to the 'Add new video' page of the iZAP Videos plugin (tested only with my revised version of iZAP Videos!) and to the 'Add photos' page of Tidypics respectively. Of course, you would have either iZAP Videos or Tidypics or both plugins installed for the menu items to appear.

In the same way as it's done here for the menu items for iZAP Videos and Tidypics other new menu items could get added to the hypeWall menu, too, using this plugin as starting point.
